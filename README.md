# warehoustodo

This my CS50x final project for 2023. 

This web-app is currently hosted at: 

https://waffers.pythonanywhere.com/

My day job is managing a small/medium warehouse. One of the problems I have is keeping all the tasks organised and the communicating the status of each task. Quite often requests are made through email or team chats or even written on scraps of paper. Itâ€™s hard to keep the tasks in order and having to reply with updates through emails and messages is time consuming.

The app is currently intended for users to be able to create and edit a task and for it to be displayed on a main dashboard. Once complete a warehouse staff member can tick it off and completed tasks will be removed from the active dashboard.

The app was built using Flask for the backend and Bootstrap for the html and css.
